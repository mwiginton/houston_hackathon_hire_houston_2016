		<h2>About Us</h2>

		<p>We are a Houston-based initiative dedicated to identifying job opportunities and helping residents obtain employment. Specifically, our goal is to help place clients of local Non-Profit organizations in jobs where they are more likely to succeed. By doing so, unemployment should decrease, along with recidivism rates in our prisons. The efficacy rate of local Non-Profits should rise, allowing them to increase their impact in the community. Our tool creates a collaborative between employers, job seekers and those who connect gaps between the two. By creating a robust, community-driven job matching platform, _______ removes this burden from local Non-Profits.</p>
